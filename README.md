# FastVideoCutter
You can select a start time and an end time or duration, and FastVideoCutter will cut the video very fast without the need to re-encode the file. Output file video quality will remain exactly the same.

Requirements:
* [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) installation. Ffmpeg.exe must either be in the same folder as this binary, or be in PATH environment variable.
